<center><a href="http://nonelectronics.com" target="_blank">Nonfinite Electronics</a> is my baby, and the first business I created while operating Nonfinite LLC. Established in 2008, Nonfinite Electronics has gone through many website overhauls and redesigns. Nonelectronics.com is currently running Opencart with heavy theme-based modifications and a number of plugins that aim to add features and overall value for our customers.</center>
