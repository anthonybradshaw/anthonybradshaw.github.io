### The relationship between a student and teacher is a fragile, delicate one. 
This is particularly true in the realm of yoga, where students can be frequently found in a vulnerable and open state and a teacher often assumes a position of power. Proper treatment of the student and of oneself as a teacher is extremely important. As such, a teacher must conduct themselves in such a way, both in the classroom and throughout the rest of their daily activities, so that they portray the “virtues” as laid forth by Patanjali. By embodying these virtues, students can grow physically, mentally, and spiritually under the careful tutelage of their teacher.

The Yoga alliance provides an excellent set of guidelines to address this topic. The alliance expects the following from RYT, E-RYT, and RYS holders:

<ul>
<li>Conduct myself in a professional and conscientious manner. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that I live up to any commitments I make to my students or to the public, and ensuring that my practices and behavior conform to the representations I make about myself in holding myself out as a yoga practitioner who adheres to certain precepts.</li>
<li>Acknowledge the limitations of my skills and scope of practice and where appropriate, refer students to seek alternative instruction, advice, treatment or direction.</li>
<li>Create and maintain a safe, clean and comfortable environment for the practice of yoga.</li>
<li>Encourage diversity by respecting all students regardless of age, physical limitations, race, creed, gender, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation.</li>
<li>Respect the rights, dignity and privacy of all students.</li>
<li>Avoid words and actions that constitute sexual harassment or harassment based on other legal protected characteristics.</li>
<li>Adhere to the traditional yoga principles as written in the yamas and niyamas.</li>
<li>Follow all local government and national laws that pertain to my yoga teaching and business.</li>
<li>These ethics principles are a good baseline for how a yoga teacher should behave, not just in the classroom but in all aspects of their life.</li>
</ul>

Moving forward from the general principles set by the Yoga alliance, there is much more to consider while teaching. The Iyengar Yoga National Association of the United States (IYNAUS) has its own, more specific set of guidelines for a yoga teacher, and while these rules are specifically set forth for teachers of the Iyengar style, they are an excellent set of principles with which to adhere to.

Some key additions to note in the IYNAUS code of conduct that move beyond the general, perhaps somewhat generic principles of the Yoga Alliance are to stay current with the teaching and practice of yoga, to not be publically critical of other Iyengar yoga teachers, (which we will reword here to encompass all yoga teachers and practitioners,) to maintain a well groomed appearance, to dress in a modest manner while teaching yoga, to avoid the abuse of drugs and alcohol, and to avoid the use of foul language.

In addition to these above principles, IYNAUS expects a teacher to avoid the cultivation of overly intimate relationships with students, and speaks at length on this topic. In the Iyengar teachings, one must respect and treat the teacher/student relationship in a similar manner as to the way a parent would treat a child. I feel this is an excellent analogy. There is a certain amount of power that is given to a teacher, and I can personally attest to having experienced this power in the form of awe and deep, intense respect for some of my past and present teachers. It is easy to see, given my own past, how powerful the teacher/student relationship is.

Max Strom spoke on this topic during my last session with him, and one particular piece of advice that sticks out in my mind is to carefully monitor one’s relationship with students, and to prevent students from forming too close of a bond to the instructor. He spoke on how some of his students would open up to him and start speaking to him as if he was a therapist or a close friend. When these times would occur, he would tell the student to keep their description of the issue relatively simple, and to spare him the details. Having heard such stories before, he would know how to address the issue without overstepping his boundaries as an instructor, thus stepping into therapist or intimate relationship realms. He went on to say that once a student enters into a space where they feel too intimately connected with him, it would be a situation where the student would “Enter a room with him, lock the door and throw away the key,” and that these situations could be extremely painful and difficult both for him and the student because he would need to be quite stern with them in explaining that such a relationship was inappropriate, thus forcibly removing them from their perception of being closer to him than they really were.

Under no circumstances do I believe this means a teacher should not care about the state of their students, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I believe Max cares for his students very deeply. There should be a boundary, however, to prevent a change of relationship from that of a teacher and a student to something else.

In order to prevent unnecessary complications in a student/teacher relationship, modest and non-provocative clothing can be used as an aid to this cause. There is no need to sexualize oneself in yoga. Many of us function in a society where we are expected to make ourselves appealing to others in everyday interactions. This is not necessary, and may actually prove detrimental to a teacher that wishes to uphold the virtues as defined by Patanjali.

### Expanding even further on the student teacher relationship, the Yoga Well Institute states the following:

<ul>
<li>It is the teacher’s responsibility to maintain relationships with students that are appropriate and professional.</li>
<li>We make only realistic statements regarding the benefits of yoga.</li>
<li>We show sensitive regard for the moral, social and religious standards of students and groups. We </li>avoid imposing our beliefs on others, although we may express them when appropriate in the yoga class.
<li>We recognize the special nature of the teacher-student relationship and hold its purpose to be supporting and facilitating the student’s healing and personal development.</li>
<li>We recognize the trust placed by the student in the teacher and the power that gives the teacher. While acknowledging the complexity of relationships, we avoid exploiting the trust and dependency of students. We avoid dual relationships with students (e.g. business, close personal or sexual relationships) as we acknowledge that they can easily impair our professional judgment, compromise the integrity of our instructions and/or become a means for our own gain. We never engage in harassment, abusive words, actions, or exploitative coercion of students or former students.</li>
<li>All forms of sexual behavior with students are unethical, even when a student invites or consents to involvement in such behavior. Sexual behavior is defined as, but not limited to all forms of overt and covert seductive speech, gestures, and behaviors in addition to any physical contact of a sexual nature.  All forms of sexual harassment are unethical. Harassment is defined as, but not limited to, repeated comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature.</li>
<li>We recognize that the teacher-student relationship involves a power imbalance, the residual effects of which remain after the student is no longer studying with the teacher. Therefore, we suggest extreme caution if you choose to enter into a personal relationship with a former student.  It is not appropriate to engage in sexual relations with a former student for at least 1 year after the end of the student-teacher relationship.</li>
<li>We do not abandon or neglect students. If we are unable, or unwilling for appropriate reasons, to provide professional help or continue a professional relationship, every reasonable effort is made to arrange for continuation of instruction with another teacher.</li>
</ul>

I find this further expansion on the ethics and behavior expected by a teacher towards students to be enlightening. Item two, which speaks on respecting the beliefs of students, is particularly important. Yoga is independent of religion, although some may consider their practice enlightening and healing in a similar fashion to a [healthy] religious practice. A teacher must be cautious not to impose their own beliefs on their students, as a teacher has a certain power dynamic that can be abused, either through intentional manipulation or careless ignorance, neither of which is acceptable.

Ultimately, the task of a yoga instructor is to aid in the betterment of their students physically, emotionally, and spiritually. This is done by embodying the characteristics the teacher would hope to see in their students and their peers, and by having the utmost respect and caution for the delicate nature of the teacher student relationship.
