It is my belief that there is no such thing as a completely safe yoga practice. While I do not possess a teacher certification yet, I have had the pleasure of taking several courses that were intended for teachers, and have gained much knowledge I hope to use in the future in regards to safety while practicing asanas. I have also studied the ways in which one can be injured doing many asanas. My studies have shown that some beginner classes and most intermediate to advanced courses have poses that be dangerous. Furthermore, any student who chooses to push themselves too far can effectively put themselves at risk for injury in almost any pose, so really, there is no way to guarantee a class will be safe for every student in a classroom.


There are several ways a teacher can reduce risk of injury, however. I have overheard Max Strom, a yogi I have studied under, say in several classrooms across the United States of America that he would like you to work at or around 80 percent maximal effort. During a weekend intensive, he spoke at length about injury. He explained that most injuries in yoga class occur from a teacher telling a student to go further, stretch farther. He has seen instructors physically push student’s limbs into positions. He said that this should never be necessary. I agree with Max on this point. Max, having taught in Los Angeles, had many stories about students who were coming to yoga class to help heal an injury. Specifically, he spoke of ballet dancers, athletes and such. He said that to take a student who comes to yoga class to heal an injury, and then to injure them in the process, is an awful thing to do and that injury prevention should be the foremost thought in the instructor’s mind when teaching asanas.


I think there is a wealth of value in emphasizing the importance of safety in every class taught. Hearing Max Strom’s personal account of his groin injury, and how it took several years to fully heal, was a significant memory for me and influenced how I go about my practice. A student won’t necessarily have a realistic outlook of what an injury will do to them. I still have a scar on my back from when I attempted to do a wall-assisted inversion and cut myself on the wall from sliding down it versus coming off of it. I wasn’t taught how to do a wall stand appropriately at the time. A little cautionary tale can go a long way to help prevent injury.


In my research, I came across an interview with a yoga instructor from New York who was well respected for teaching in such a way that his classes are considered very suitable for treatment of injury and safety. In this interview, the instructor spoke of how even a prolonged, safe yoga practice can cause deterioration of joints and ligaments over time. After over ten years of teaching, he had to get an operation on his spine to correct damage done from prolonged practice. This further proves that there is no entirely safe yoga practice, even when approached with the utmost care.


Still, there are ways to reduce injury. As a teacher, one should ensure that their students are appropriately dressed with clothing that allows for free movement without restriction. A warm up is always necessary before moving into difficult or challenging asanas, and an instructor should guide their class through easy movements and breathing practice before picking up the pace.


An instructor should keep a watchful eye on students, especially those they can recognize as beginners. They should also watch for signs of struggle or pain in the practitioner’s face. An instructor should ensure their students are properly hydrated, particularly if you are teaching a hot or bikram type class.


In regards to watching the exertion levels of your students in class, I believe Max Strom is extremely good at this. Several times throughout my training he pointed out that most of us in the class looked like we were angry. He would say things like “Why do you all look so angry? Are you trying your hardest? Don’t do that. Relax. Smile. Remember to breathe! This is a breathing practice with asanas tied in to it, not an asana practice with breathing tied in. Put pranayama first, asanas second while you are here.” Reminding his students that yoga is not a battle, (except with competitive yoga, which is an entirely different story and highly controversial,) seemed very effective at keeping strain down in the classroom, both mentally and physically. A student will frequently forget to monitor themselves when in the act of asanas, so it is important to watch themselves for them.


There are certain areas of the body that tend to get injured more often than others in yoga practice. There are ways to reduce injury in these places:.


Wrist injuries are common in yoga, and can be prevented by spreading one’s weight when in plank, downward dog, and other asanas where one puts weight on the wrists by spreading your fingers and dispersing your weight through the fingers and palms.


Elbow injuries can occur from improper chaturanga. To prevent this, instruct the student to keep their elbows tucked in as they lower down. This is a natural range of motion for the arms and elbows. Do not allow students to bow out their elbows when lowering down.


Shoulders can be damaged by raising them up too close to the ears during poses like upward facing dog. Instruct students to relax the shoulders, moving them down and back. I personally find that being reminded to do this several times in a 60-90 minute class is frequently necessary.


Intercostal muscles between the ribs can be bruised during twists. In order to prevent this, instruct the student to lengthen the spine by imagining a string at the top of your head pulling you upwards. Do this before entering into a twist. Placing the palm of your hand on top of the student’s head and asking them to push upwards gently against the palm is also a good way to accomplish this requirement.


Lower back pain is the most commonly cited pain area or injury in yoga practice. This is frequently due to rounding of the spine during forward folds and downward dog. In order to prevent this, again, instruct the student to lengthen the spine before entering into these poses. The string technique works well. I have also had an instructor gently place the palm of their hand on the crown of my head and instruct me to push gently up against the palm. This was extremely effective for me and I intend to use it in the classroom.


Hamstrings are a problem area for practitioners who sit in front of a desk or have other non-mobile jobs. The hamstrings can be injured in forward folds. A good way to warm up the hamstrings is to do downward dog or lunges. Warming up the muscles with a soft stretch such as down dog will allow for a safer continued practice.


Hips can be injured by overextending their range of motion through poses such as warrior poses, wide legged forward bends, and splits. Personally, I have never been instructed to perform a split in class nor would I instruct others to do so. A fix for this in warrior poses is to make sure that the toes are pointed forward in any pose where the hips are squared off in the same direction.


Knees can be strained in cross legged poses or while sitting in Vajrasana. Use of extra padding can come in handy for the latter, while placing blocks under the knees while in cross legged poses can help with the former.


Neck injuries can occur from head and shoulder stands. A beginner SHOULD NOT do these poses without very close supervision. I have injured myself doing inversions in a classroom, and I believe this happened because of poor instruction in an overcrowded classroom. For an experienced yogi, inversions can be made safer by making sure the shoulder blades are drawn down and back so as to safely support the body. 


My ten (plus one) safety guidelines will be as such:


Tell your students to put their safety first at the beginning of every class.
Guide your students through a warm-up session at the start of every class.
Remind your students to spread their fingers in plank and down dog to prevent wrist injury. Tell them why they are doing this. I had been doing yoga for over years before I learned how this can prevent injury. It helps to know why you are asked to do things.
Remind your students to lengthen their spine before forward folds. Explain why.
Don’t overcrowd the classroom. Injury becomes more likely when the instructor cannot keep an eye on the entire class comfortably.
Remind your students to check their egos at the door. Pushing oneself too hard is the number one cause of injury. 
Remind your students to be mindful and accepting of what your body is capable of at that particular moment in time.
Ask students if they have any pre-existing injuries before proceeding with class.
Remind students to come out of poses slowly.
Recommend the use of props for those who need them. Again, ego at the door! Using blocks, straps, or blankets does not make you a bad yogi. It makes you a wise yogi! 
Remind students to do what works for them, not what works for the person next to them.




I want to emphasize again that yoga, even when done properly, can cause harm. There is no guaranteed safe physical practice. With caution and some preparation, however, a more safe practice can be obtained.
