### Anatomy has an inseparable connectedness to yoga and, indeed, every human experience. Our breath, how we function as living organisms, and how we move through our postures, whether on a yoga mat or functioning in some other capacity, are all dependant on our anatomy. 
Our physical bodies, or our anatomy, aides us in interacting with the atmosphere of our planet among other things. It provides a space for storage of essential organs and a processing facility for converting food into nutrients and waste products. It helps us deal with atmospheric pressure and gravitational pull through use of organs like our skin, bones, muscles, and ligaments. 

Much like the breath, our anatomy will function with or without our knowledge of its inner workings. Even if one does not practice pranayama (focused breath practice), they will still breathe in such a way as to ensure continued life, barring some abnormality in health or environment. In the same way as one can gain a better understanding of the breath, and in turn, oneself through a practical knowledge of pranayama, so too can a practitioner’s asanas be improved on by the academic study of the body and movement.

A practitioner of yoga who would endeavor to possess a more functional knowledge of the working of the human body in the hopes of improving their yogic practice should consider these fundamental items:

<ul>
<li>The breath - Lungs, thoracic and abdominal cavities, and the diaphragm</li>
<li>The spine, how it interacts with and supports the rest of the skeleton, and how it serves many purposes related to breath.</li>
<li>An integrated study of posture and the rest of our skeletal structure</li>
<li>Bones and their multiple purposes</li>
<li>Muscles</li>
<li>Joints and ligaments</li>
<li>How all of these items interact</li>
</ul>

An excellent place to begin is with the understanding that as long as we are “alive” in the traditional sense of the word, we are in movement; all actions, even inert actions, involve movement for a living being, be it plant or animal. For humans, the most basic and essential of actions that sustain us in the act of life is breathing. 

### The breath is itself a complex series of actions or movements within the human body utilizing muscle, bone, and organs. Breathing can be carried out autonomously by the human body, meaning we do not need to think about breathing to breathe, but that does not mean the act of breathing is simple, or that we cannot benefit from having a better understanding of this essential operation that not only keeps us alive but allows us to connect with our physical, mental, and spiritual selves. 


The muscle that performs the alteration of three dimensional space inside the thoracic and abdominal cavities, “breathing” as we have named it, is called the diaphragm. The diaphragm forms the barrier between the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and is shaped by the organs that push against it, forming two asymmetrical domes. The heart pushes above on the left of the diaphragm forming the smaller of the two domes while the liver pushes up on the right side of the diaphragm, forming the larger dome. The diaphragm extends up into the ribs, surrounding the lungs and heart, and down into the pelvis. The vertically running fibers of the diaphragm contract, pulling the thoracic and abdominal cavities towards one another, creating space in the body for the lungs to operate through both inhalation and exhalation.

Each time we inhale, our diaphragms allow our thoracic (chest) and abdominal cavities to shift in such a way that the lungs are pulled open, creating a vacuum that is then filled with what we call “air” by means of atmospheric pressure. It would be inaccurate to say our lungs inflate. Instead, our lungs are pulled open by the physical work of our body, (similar to a bellows,) and are then filled with air due to the laws of physics and the nature of the world we reside upon. A similar but inverse process is initiated for exhalation: muscles push air out of the lungs into the atmosphere and the cycle then repeats.

Once we realize we are always in movement, and that breath, too, is movement, the distinctions between breath, posture, asana, and movement begins to fade. We can begin to incorporate and unify our breath with our yoga practice and the rest of our lives more effectively.

## A key concept to better understanding the human breath is that the lungs can be utilized in several different ways. 
Abdominal or belly breathing, as it is often called, is a type of breathing practiced instinctually by many living organisms in a relaxed state. In this type of breathing the abdominal cavity shifts allowing the lungs to expand out to where the stomach and other organs were previously. In thoracic, or chest breathing, the rib cage expands outward allowing the lungs to fill in such a fashion that one might envision themselves breathing in through their upper back, sides, and chest during such a practice. 

Although breath can be focused into either the thoracic or abdominal cavity, both of these areas of the body function in cooperation during each breath to form a complete breath cycle. An active exhalation, such as the act of blowing out candles, singing, repetition of a mantra, or rapid, forced breath practices such as Breath of Fire, taught by the Kundalini school of yoga, will cause the abdominal cavity to push upwards into the thoracic cavity, forcing air out of the lungs. The thoracic and abdominal cavities never function independently of one another.

Chest breathing is sometimes called shallow breathing, but this is a misnomer. In actuality, our lungs can retain a larger capacity of gases through chest breathing than through abdominal breathing. This is why study of anatomy is important, in both yoga and in the practice of healthy, aware living. Sometimes our instincts and our cultural beliefs are mistaken or lacking. The breath can be altered in many ways to suit our needs as living beings, but in order to fully harness the power and versatility of our breath we must first elevate ourselves to a place beyond where we merely allow our bodies to function instinctually.

Now that we have an rudimentary model of how the breath works, and we understand that breath is movement, and thus we are always moving, we can come to understand that the spine is also part of the breath, and thus always in movement as well. 

While the spine serves as a support structure for our bidepal, locomotive bodies, it can also allow for a wide range of movement. The human spine has curves that can extend, compress, and twist much like a spring, allowing for both rigidity and mobility.
These curves are named the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral, moving from the head down to the pelvis. In a simplified context, one can envision that these natural curves exist in the adult human body as a means of compensating for gravitation pull while allowing us to function as bipedal organisms.

The spine shifts during a breath, both as our muscles make space in our abdominal and thoracic cavities for air to be taken in, and again as exhalation takes place. The body can be viewed as a well-coordinated pressurized system where space is used efficiently and minimally, without waste. This means that as a breath is taken in, the spine and other parts of the body must shift in order to make room for air to be stored and processed by the lungs.

In yoga, a practitioner will often be using their spine in various ways to move into, hold, and exit from an asana. The spine is also intrinsic to the act of breathing, which is why such a large component of yoga practice involves coordinating the movements of the spine with the process of inhaling and exhaling. During a breath in, the spine exhibits extension, which can be pictured as the form one assumes in Cow of Cat/Cow pose, (bowed back, head up.) On an exhalation the spine exhibits flexion, which can be matched with Cat, (arched back, head down). These movements may not be as pronounced in a normal breath cycle as in cat/cow pose, but the movements, extension and flexion, are the same. This is why we inhale as we rise from standing forward bend to mountain pose, and exhale as we flow into forward bend from standing: we are inhaling as we extend the spine, and exhaling as we flex the spine inwards, which we already do naturally when we breathe. This pattern can be found in many asanas and in the movements or “flow” between them.

### A yogi can practice yoga without an understanding of many of these elements, as a living being can breathe without knowing how their breath works, but there is much to be gained from a better understanding of how and why our bodies function as they do. 

Once a practitioner of yoga comes to understand that breath is movement, that the spine is a part of the breath, and thus, one should consider their breath as intrinsic to not just pranayama but to the asanas as well, they will find their practice more engaging for the body and mind. Better still is when the practitioner finds that their practice is no longer limited to the mat, and this understanding of the self comes to influence how one breathes and holds themselves throughout their daily life.
