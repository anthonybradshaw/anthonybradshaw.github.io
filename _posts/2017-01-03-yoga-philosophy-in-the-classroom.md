### “The success of yoga does not lie in the ability to perform postures, but in how it positively changes the way we live our life and our relationships.” -TKV Desikachar

##### In order to practice Yogic philosophy, either inside or outside of class, one must first know what Yoga is. 
In this respect, I believe a scholarly approach is advantageous to a yogi who hopes to accelerate their practice. It has been said that all the answers are within us; that through self study and inner exploration we can find the solutions we need to become the persons we wish to be in the life. This is true, but it is also a biological, genetic fact that as humans we are built with the keen ability to observe and learn to an extent far beyond the abilities of other species we share this world with. Experiential wisdom has value, and while learning through doing is an undeniable, core part of the human experience, it also has its drawbacks. Experiential wisdom takes time, which is a very precious resource, and it sometimes carries the risk of failure. In the Yogic context, failure could mean a physical injury.

Think of observing the movements, listening to the orations, or reading the written words of an experienced yogi as the act of observing and learning from their experiential wisdom. In this way you can safely accelerate your practice exponentially. Carry this mental framework with you going forward in your studies.

Many teachers have expounded on what acts make up Yoga. Reading the teachings of the Yoga masters, one quickly notices that the definition of Yoga is oftentimes the very first thing a guide will expound upon in their writings. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras and TKV Desikachar’s “Heart of Yoga” both begin with explanations of the term.

Desikachar highlighted these definitions of what Yoga is in the opening of his book, “The Heart of Yoga”:

<ul>
<li>To come together</li>
<li>To unite</li>
<li>To tie the strands of the mind together</li>
<li>To be one with the divine</li>
<li>To be attentive and present</li>
</ul>

Desikachar highlights that while coming together suggests a physical practice and tying the strands of the mind together suggests a mental practice, in actuality both are interconnected. Through setting our intention, we can then undertake the practice of asana and pranayama. This is a key concept: nothing is isolated. The same can be said of Yoga itself. In its entirety, Yoga is awareness, practice, change, the act of gaining new understanding through study or practice, the pursuit of divinity, and the slowing of entropy. Even the act of learning the meaning of the word “Yoga” with the help of a text is, by definition, Yoga. As such, when practiced thoroughly, Yoga encompasses the entire life and existence of the practicing yogi.

### Understanding that Yoga is all-encompassing, we can now approach the question of how to use Yogic philosophy practically in the classroom. 
Essentially, what I have tried to show you thus far is that in its true form, Yoga is all-encompassing, and as such, one who practices yoga never truly leaves the classroom, for all of life becomes the classroom.

Sri Swami Sivananda said this of study in yoga:

“This world is a great school. This world is for your education. You learn several valuable lessons daily. If you are wise enough to utilise all opportunities to the best possible advantage in the spirit of Yoga, your capacities and will-power will develop to an astonishing degree. You will grow. You will evolve. You will expand. There will be integral development. You will march forward towards the goal. All veils will drop down one by one. All limitations or barriers will be annihilated. All shackles or fetters will be torn asunder. You will receive more and more Divine Light Knowledge, Purity, Peace and Spiritual Strength.”

And so, under the advisement of our masters, we practice with attention and focus on becoming a more divine version of ourselves. Karma yoga, the path of joyous work, advises the yogi to give up the ego in the pursuit of the realization that there is no “I”, and that they are part of a great Oneness. It is not the task itself that matters, but the attitude while doing it that determines if Karmic Yoga is being practiced. Any job can be a liberating job, and any job can be a binding job. Work can be worship. Asanas are a type of work. Swami Sivananda advises us to "give your hands to work, and keep your mind fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord."

The venerated texts we pore over as scholars of the Yogic arts are sometimes quite dense, and packed with seemingly infinite meaning within the space of a few lines of text. I feel it is important to state in plain words that the pursuit of Oneness in yoga will have the effect of changing the world-view of the practicing yogi. One who finds even a brief moment of Oneness, losing all or part of the ego during their practice, will find themselves confronted with Universal love. In the face of this experience, limitations melt away. With a loss of self we also lose the fear associated with the concept of the self and we begin to act out of that Universal love. 

#### This is when our divinity is realized and the God in all of us shines through, and we begin to positively affect others around us with our energy. This is perhaps the ultimate pursuit of Yoga: the pursuit of divinity through Godly action, perception, and compassion.

So, to summarize: the act of practicing yogic philosophy is to pursue a unification of the self, and in so doing pursue a unification with a higher self, everywhere and at all times, if our practice is being done to the extent as was advised by the masters before us. Karmic Yoga dictates that we must not only give ourselves to our work when we are on the mats, but elsewhere in our lives as well. We must pursue Oneness at all times, not just in the classroom. Through loss of the self we lose the limitations of the self, and become part of a greater whole, obtaining, in essence, immortality in our understanding of our interconnectedness with all other things. This enlightenment brings with it freedom from our own human limitations. In a word: health. Through Yoga one can find release from human existential suffering and, in the process, find God both throughout themselves and all around them.

Sri Swami Sivananda said “Cosmic Love is all-embracing and all-inclusive. In the presence of pure love all distinctions and differences, all hatred, jealousy and egoism are dispelled just as darkness is dispelled by the penetrating rays of the morning sun. There is no religion higher than Love. There is no knowledge higher than Love. There is no treasure higher than Love, because Love is Truth, Love is God. This world came out of Love; it exists in Love and it will ultimately dissolve in Love. A heart without love is a desert without water. God is an ocean of Love. In every corner of His creation, you can see ample evidence of His unbounded Love for His children.”

The world of Yoga can sometimes be confusing or convoluted as a subject of study. This is partially because there are no isolated areas of study in Yoga. The study of any particular subject will ultimately lead to the study of a connected subject. For example: one who seeks to understand pranayama on a deep level must understand how breath is taken, both as an inhalation and an exhalation, which leads to the study of anatomy. As such the discussion of any particular topic in Yoga leads to discussion of other fields of study.

As the writer of this essay, I keep coming back to the topic at hand: Practical Yoga in the classroom. I find myself explaining multiple times that it’s all a classroom, and as such, all of the yogic teachings apply. Practical. What is practical? The dictionary states practical means “of or concerned with the actual doing or use of something rather than with theory and ideas.” If I could paraphrase this question then, this essay topic, I would reword it to “Please submit an essay about the active use of Yogic thinking in your
Classes”, and frankly that sentence confuses the hell out of me. I don’t know how to expound on the physical act of thinking.

What I can say for sure is that students in my classroom will part with an understanding that it’s all a classroom, that removal of the ego through dedication to one’s practice will provide incredible reward, that God is everywhere, even inside you, and that it’s all a classroom.
