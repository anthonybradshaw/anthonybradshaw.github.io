<center>The <a href="#">Wisconsin Women's Health Foundation</a> works throughout the state of Wisconsin to provide smoking cessation programs, breast cancer awareness education and funding for treatment, and a knowledge hub for nursing practitioners targeted around women. In 2016 I began working for them as a remote desktop support specialist. This contract has continued on into 2017.</center>
